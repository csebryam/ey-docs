# Lithium

Using Lithium with Orchestra is easy. For your convenience we've even created a public Github repository that contains a custom <a href="https://github.com/orchestra-io/sample-lithium">Lithium code example</a>.

If you would like to deploy this application:

  1. Go to your Orchestra dashboard and click on **Deploy new App**
  2. Copy `git://github.com/orchestra-io/sample-lithium.git` into your **Repo URL**
  3. Set your **Index File** to `app/webroot/index.php`
  4. Click on **Launch**

Once your application is deployed, go to your application URL and you will see the Lithium index page.

Lithium is the fast, sleek, next-generation framework for PHP 5.3+ that strikes the elusive balance between robust, maintainable code, and just getting things done. Lithium's set of no-nonsense tools and philosophies will help you write more flexible apps faster, with it's unified configuration and unique aspect-oriented filter system. Environment-based configuration is at its core, making it easy to change how an application operates in different contexts, without hard-coding conditions into application logic. This and other innovations make it ideal for deploying apps to cloud-based architectures like Orchestra.io.
