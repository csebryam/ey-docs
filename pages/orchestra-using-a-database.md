# Using a Database

As MySQL is still the predominant database choice for most PHP developers, the Orchestra platform allows developers to easily create MySQL databases through the Dashboard interface. 

# <a name="mysql"></a>MySQL Orchestra Database

After you've deployed your application, you should be taken back to your application dashboard. If you expand your newly created application, you will see a **NEW DATABASE** button:

If you click on the **NEW DATABASE** button, the system will create a MySQL database, username and password for you and associate it with your application:

With the settings provided you should be able to login to https://mysql.orchestra.io to manage your application.
