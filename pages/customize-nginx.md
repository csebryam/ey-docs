# Customize Nginx

Introduction about why I might want to customize / configure Nginx. If I stumble upon this page in a search, reading this intro should convey definitively if this is the right page for me now.  (It shouldn't start telling me what I need to do -- keep everything that readers actually need to do in the steps of the procedure -- this is much easier to follow than actions hiding in blurby paragraphs with strange verb tenses.) 

If it's a lot of steps (more than ~7), break them up into smaller procedures and group the procedures in a process.

The process is:

1. [<Procedure 1>.][1]
2. [<Procedure 2>.][2]
n. [<Procedure n>.][<n>]

Intro about the purpose of these steps and what you achieve at the end of these steps. What why when (all the **how** goes into the steps).

###To do 1

1. Do this. (Use the imperative tense.)

2. Do that.
