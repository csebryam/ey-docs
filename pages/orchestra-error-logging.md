# Simple Error Logging

Orchestra provides developers with the ability to retrieve their PHP Error Logs through the Web-Interface. In order to do this, you have to first enable the addon at https://my.orchestra.io/addons

Once you've enabled this addon, your basic and elastic applications will now have a ***View Server Logs*** button:

Clicking on this button will take you to a screen where your errors are listed:

For ***Basic*** and ***Elastic*** applications, the errors are not displayed as they are presumably production applications and we wouldn't want to feed error-garbage to your users, therefore, you can see the logs in the Error Reporting interface.
