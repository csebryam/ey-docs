# Zend Framework

Using Zend Framework with Orchestra is easy. For your convenience we've even created a public github repository that contains a custom <a href="https://github.com/orchestra-io/sample-zend-framework">Zend Framework code example</a>.

If you would like to deploy this application:

  1. Go to your Orchestra dashboard and click on **Deploy new App**
  2. Copy `git://github.com/orchestra-io/sample-zend-framework.git` into your **Repo URL**
  3. Set your **Index File** to `example/public/index.php` then deploy the application.
  4. Click on **Launch**

Once your application is deployed, go to your application URL and you will see the Zend Framework greeting.

Extending the art & spirit of PHP, Zend Framework is based on simplicity, object-oriented best practices, corporate friendly licensing, and a rigorously tested agile codebase. Zend Framework is focused on building more secure, reliable, and modern Web 2.0 applications & web services, and consuming widely available APIs from leading vendors like Google, Amazon, Yahoo!, Flickr, as well as API providers and cataloguers like StrikeIron and ProgrammableWeb.

Zend Framework differentiates itself from other frameworks in several key ways. First, it rigorously defends the rights of end-users to use and distribute the framework however they want, through a combination of a New BSD License (http://framework.zend.com/license) and requiring contributions under the umbrella of a Contributors License Agreement (http://framework.zend.com/cla).

Second, it can be used as either a full-stack MVC library for complex web applications, or as a loosely-coupled component library where developers may pick and choose components to solve application issues. Finally, a vigorous community process ensures that the components shipped with Zend Framework receive broad scrutiny and review.

Zend Framework sponsors the [SimpleCloud](https://docs.orchestra.io/kb/system-constraints/system-constraints#frameworks-s3-libraries) initiative, and ships with the Zend_Cloud component, which provides an API-agnostic approach to developing PHP applications that make use of cloud-based storage, document databases, or queue services. Additionally, its flexible and environment-focussed configuration system make it trivially easy to migrate from development to deployment, making cloud deployment not only possible, but a well-supported use-case.
