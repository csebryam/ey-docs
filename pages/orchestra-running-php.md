# Running PHP

Orchestra being a PHP platform requires the users of the platform to have a running PHP local environment. If you require more help into setting PHP locally please open a support request.

 - **Linux**: [Running XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html), [Google Search for Installing PHP, Nginx on linux](http://www.google.com/search?q=installing+PHP,+Nginx+Linux)
 - **OS X**: [Running MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html), [Google Search for Installing PHP, NGinx on OSX](http://www.google.com/search?q=installing+PHP,+Nginx+OSX)
 - **Windows**: [Running WAMP Server](http://www.wampserver.com/en/)
 
Please note that the aforementioned links are all using Apache but our service uses Nginx. If you wish to setup Nginx, I would suggest following the Google Search links. If you are on Windows, you can effectively develop your application using WAMP, but make sure you are using APC and not eAccelerator as Orchestra only supports APC.
